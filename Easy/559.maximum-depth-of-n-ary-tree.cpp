 * Testcase Example:  '{"$id":"1","children":[{"$id":"2","children":[{"$id":"5","children":[],"val":5},{"$id":"6","children":[],"val":6}],"val":3},{"$id":"3","children":[],"val":2},{"$id":"4","children":[],"val":4}],"val":1}'
 *
 * Given a n-ary tree, find its maximum depth.
 * 
 * The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the
 * root node down to the farthest leaf node.
 * 
 * For example, given a 3-ary tree:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * We should return its max depth, which is 3.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * The depth of the tree is at most 1000.
 * The total number of nodes is at most 5000.
